Data Bootcamp Week Twenty One Neural Networks and Deep Learning

This project aims to develop a deep learning model to predict the target variable (e.g., whether an organization is successful based on its features) using the Alphabet Soup dataset. The dataset includes various features about different organizations, and the goal is to classify each organization based on these features.

In this project, I built a deep learning model to predict whether an organization is going to make it or not. Using a dataset called Alphabet Soup, I trained the model to learn from features about organizations and classify them based on success or failure. The goal was to get the modelâ€™s accuracy above 75%.

After about 5 attempts of tweaking the preprocessing, and model itself, we did not reach that goal. I believe maybe there are other classification models better suited than
a deep learning model, and maybe for future work we could test that theory out, because the unreached goal could 100% be due to my inexperience with deep learning.

Overall the model performed okay, despite the val loss going up by a tiny bit, I did manage getting the overall accuracy to be a percent better.
